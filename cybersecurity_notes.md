# ✅ **SUMMARY & EXPLANATION**

## **I. What is Cybersecurity?**

Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting computers, phones, networks, and data from attacks.
It focuses on preventing:

* Unauthorized access
* Data theft
* Damage to systems
* Disruption of services

It applies everywhere—business, government, personal devices, and the internet.

## **II. Course Description**

### **1. Why CompTIA Security+?**

Security+ is recommended as the **first cybersecurity certificate** for beginners.
It proves you understand the basics of:

* Network security
* Threat detection
* Hands-on security troubleshooting

With Security+, you can apply for many **entry-level cybersecurity jobs.**

### **2. Course Objectives**

After completing the course, you should be able to:

* Identify security roles and controls
* Understand threat actors and intelligence
* Assess systems for weaknesses
* Detect malware and social engineering
* Use cryptography and PKI
* Configure authentication and identity management
* Secure networks, devices, cloud, IoT, and mobile
* Handle incident response and digital forensics
* Understand risk management and resilience
* Apply physical security

## **III. Major Cyber Threats (2020 Cases)**

### **1. Nintendo Data Breach**

160,000 accounts hacked.
Hackers used stolen logins to buy digital items.
Nintendo removed the NNID login feature and advised users to use two-factor authentication.

### **2. Twitter Spear-Phishing Attack**

High-profile accounts (Obama, Biden, Musk, etc.) were hacked through employee manipulation.
Hackers posted a fake Bitcoin giveaway.
Over $100,000 was stolen.

### **3. Zoom Credentials Hack**

Over 500,000 Zoom passwords leaked and sold on the dark web.
Hackers used them to join meetings and steal personal info.

### **4. American Bank Systems Ransomware**

Attackers leaked **52GB of data** when the company refused ransom.
Banks using ABS software were indirectly exposed to risk.

### **5. The Business of Hacking**

Hackers can be motivated by:

* Money
* Organized crime
* Corporate espionage
* Hacktivism
* Cyber warfare

Some hacking operations are extremely profitable.

## **IV. Cybersecurity Ethics**

Cybersecurity protects:

* People
* Institutions (schools, hospitals, banks, governments)
* Critical infrastructure

Example:
Securing a hospital network helps protect **patient lives**, not just computers.

Cybersecurity professionals indirectly protect society.

## **V. Information Security Basics (CIA Triad)**

### **CIA = Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability**

1. **Confidentiality** – Only authorized people should access data.
2. **Integrity** – Data must be accurate and not changed without permission.
3. **Availability** – Authorized users should always be able to access information.

These three pillars must be **balanced**, like a tripod.

---

## **VI. Cybersecurity Framework (NIST)**

NIST divides cybersecurity work into **five functions**:

1. **Identify** – Understand your assets, risks, and policies.
2. **Protect** – Implement security controls, secure software, and hardware.
3. **Detect** – Monitor systems to identify attacks early.
4. **Respond** – Contain, analyze, and eliminate threats.
5. **Recover** – Restore systems and improve resilience.

---

## **VII. Information Security Competencies**

Typical duties of a security professional include:

* Risk assessments
* Installing secure systems
* Managing user privileges
* Monitoring logs
* Incident response
* Disaster recovery planning
* Security training

---

## **VIII. Roles and Responsibilities**

* **CISO / CSO** – Head of security in an organization
* **Managers** – Oversee security in specific domains (IT, buildings, etc.)
* **Technical staff / Admins** – Implement and maintain security controls
* **All employees** – Must follow security policies
* **Directors / Owners** – Ultimately accountable for security failures

---

## **IX. Security Business Units**

### **1. Security Operations Center (SOC)**

A centralized team that:

* Monitors threats
* Defends the organization’s digital assets
* Works 24/7 in large companies

### **2. DevSecOps**

Integrates security directly into software development and operations.
Security becomes part of the process from the beginning (shift-left approach).

### **3. Incident Response Team (CSIRT/CIRT/CERT)**

A specialized team responsible for:

* Handling attacks
* Providing a point of contact for security incidents
* Coordinating response actions

---

# ✅ **In short…**

Cybersecurity protects computers, data, and systems that society depends on.
Security+ prepares you for beginner security roles.
The CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) is the foundation of information security.
Organizations use frameworks like NIST to manage risks.
Special units like SOC and incident response teams handle monitoring and attacks.
Ethics is crucial because cybersecurity ultimately protects **human lives and institutions.**
